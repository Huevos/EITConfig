msgid "Purpose of 'blacklist'. In contrast to the above, sometimes the data provided on the transport stream, either EIT or Now/Next is not reliable and we prefer just the data from the online import. In these cases the channel in question can be added to the 'blacklist' and then no data from the current transport stream will enter the EPG cache and the online imported data will persist."

#: ../src/plugin.py:547
msgid "Purpose of 'whitelist'. Sometimes real time data from Now/Next is preferable to the online imported data which may be stale. Adding a channel to the 'whitelist' allows Now/Next data for that channel to be saved in the epgcache, rather than just being discarded on channel change, and the Now/Next data will overwrite the online imported data."
